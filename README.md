# Sprint Challenge: Hash Tables and Blockchain

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint, we learned how hash tables combine two data structures to get the best of both worlds and were introduced into the fascinating world of blockchains. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by solving algorithms in Python using hash tables and add another key feature to your blockchain.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in Python and your command of the concepts and techniques in related to hash tables and blockchains.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

This sprint challenge is divided up into three parts:  Hash tables coding, blockchain coding, and a short interview covering parts of hash tables and blockchain.

## Interview Questions

Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:
* What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?
* What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?

### The runtime complexity to access an array is o(1), meaning it's going to be the same time no matter how small or large the array is
### The runtime complexity to add or remove from the front is o(n) because those behind it need to be shifted over
### The runtime complexity to add to the back is o(1), however if the array is full then o(n) because youâ€™ll have resize and re add them to a new array
### The runtime complexity to remove from the back is o(1), unless a larger array is needed then o(n) because of copying over
### O(n) is the worst case because you need to make a bigger array which means more allocating a bigger memory block and then copy over all the elements

Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?
 
### A blockchain is structured and organized by the blocks in the chain consisting of the previous hash. A block should have an index, a timestamp, transactions, a proof, and the previous hash of the one that came before the current block. 

Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack. What kind of attack is possible?

### A proof of work is simply a consensus system. It functions by using the sha256 and it checks for the proof with the most leading zeros. The number of leading zeros needed to pass is determined by those in charge of the chain. When the proof is determined valid the node hashes the previous block and adds it to the chain and ensures the previous hash listed on the block matches with actual previous block in the chain. All of these checks protects the blockchain from attacks, because if someone were to attempt to add to the blockchain forcefully, they would have to ensure their previous hash matches with the actual previous has but by doing so changes the previous hash which makes that one then incorrect. Also they would have to redo the entire chain fast enough before another block is forged through a valid proof or else the attempts to change it would be a waste because their hash is no longer valid. 





## Project Set Up

#### [Hash Tables]

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through two algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the .py skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with make tests.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing (using a hash table to do it). You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the hashtable.py file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly).

*You may not use any advanced, built-in Python functions to solve these problems.*

#### [Blockchain]

For the blockchain portion of the challenge, you will be writing code for a new miner that will solve a different Proof of Work algorithm than the one we have been working with.

Your goal is to mine at least one coin.  Keep in mind that with many people competing over the same coins, this may take a long time.  By our math, we expect that an average solution should be the first to find a solution at least once in an hour or two of mining.
